        <p>Hello my name is <strong>Jay Pasco</strong>, I am the coder for this website you see here
          , cool huh?
          <!-- strong tags are a way to bold the texts within your webpage, also a <br> is what breaks it and brings
          the next sentence below so it will not stretch out too long-->
        <br> Nothing to fancy but it is a start and will only progress from here. I enjoy to draw on my
        spare time usually freestyling, or watching great films such as <em>Intersellar</em>,
        <br><em>Django Unchained</em> or any strong story driven arcs with damaged characters to
          give a feel of real life relatable properties to connect audiences' with so called film making.</p>
        <p>One of my hobbies is going to the pier & fish for game, sometimes you get a bite or a few,
          depends on your awareness and skills to get lure. Best thing about fishing<br>
          is that anyone can do it, effortlessly with the right bait and rod. Here is a quick list of what to
          bring with you for your <strong>First Fishing Trip! </strong> </p>
          <p><em>If you could visit any place in the world, where would you pick? For me personally <br>
            it would be Vencie, Italy. Venice has a rich history but most importantly Venice will not be here
            forever. Inevitably it will be flooded by the Mediterranean sea by 2100.</em> This will <br>
            be a dream of mine to, explore the vast beauty of Venice, which hopefully I can be welcomed
            by the locals, becasue I do appreicate their culture.
            <!--added an unordered list without the bullets for better look
            using css  and also added <em> =""-->
      <h3>Fishing Tips & Tricks For 1st Timers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fishing bait- <em>Shrimp, Octopus, Tackle lures, Worms, Small Mackerel</em></li>
          <li>Fishing Accessories - <em>Scaler, Balance Digital Fishing Scale, Pilers</em></li>
          <li>Fishing Hooks - <em>Point, Barb, Throat, Bend, Shank, Eye</em></li>
          <li>Extras - <em>Fishing Net, Ice container, Extra Rod</em></li>
        </ul>
        <small><p style="text-align:center">Also not required but optional. Bring some scented hand
          sanitizer if you're going to handle <br>live bait or frozen, it sure leaves a fishy smell.
          It is a headache to get rid of without
          a shower.

          <!-- using a P tag to describe why I adore this dish and why it is close to heart, as well as define the ingredients
          in these two dishes.-->
          <p>Lomo saltado is, in reality, a deeply thoughtful dish made with a set of ingredients and techniques that reflect the mix of cultures that contributed to its existence. It's an example of chifa cooking, a term that <br>describes the Chinese-Peruvian hybrid cuisine created by Chinese immigrants who moved to South America more than a century ago, as well as the restaurants where that food is served.
        This particular dish combines indigenous<br> American ingredients, like potatoes,tomatoes, and peppers, with Chinese ingredients and techniques, like soy sauce and stir-frying. Some versions call for tossing the French fries directly into the wok to coat them in the sauce while <br> others put the fries on the side to maintain their crispy texture. My dad is from Peru so I, eat this dish often becaue my grandma knows I love it and she always make me it and sometimes with chicken which is called "Pollo Saltado".</p>
